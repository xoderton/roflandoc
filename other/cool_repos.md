# cool_repos.md
Useful, necessary or just funny repositories from github that I have met in my life.

## @ osutify

- [Spotify](https://spotify.com/) but with [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/) songs, cool isn't it?! [@richardscull](https://github.com/richardscull/) recently followed me, and he was developer of this project, and it honestly looks sick to me.

  - Repository: [Click Me!](https://github.com/richardscull/osutify)

  - Website: [Click Me!](https://osutify.vercel.app/)

## @ cobalt

- `4K Video Downloader`, `SaveFrom` and other programs that named like trojans or malwares. Everyone probably heard atleast one program that is related to downloading or saving stuff from internet, and [cobalt.tools](https://cobalt.tools/) combines all of them in one website with ***FRIENDLY*** user interface, making it much easier to do it!
