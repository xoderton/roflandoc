Server Core(s) are the main part of servers, because without it, we couldn't play on them and possibly couldn't connect to our close friends, in this topic, we'll try to decide, which core should be used to balance all factors.

Factors? What are those? I'm talking about Performance and Vanilla-like factors, first is pretty much obvious, but what about second one, well, some cores are doing things that destroy in some way default vanilla style of Minecraft in favour of something other, and that's not something administrators or even players will like, so this factor is very important to us.

## [Paper](https://papermc.io)
Paper is the most popular core that is beind used literally everywhere, because it's very performant and has almost latest security fixes/patches that will mitigate exploits on your server. However, that doesn't mean, that it will be great everywhere and should be used without any doubt, because Paper has some issues... with Redstone and Farms, [`cubicmetre`]() in his video about [`PaperMC`]() already talked about it, so you might wanna watch it instead, but TL;DR, they are implementing fixes/patches that are breaking farms that could be based on these *"""issues"""*, for example, TNT duplications using contraptions with slime blocks and corals are blocked by default in config, and these machines are very important to some farms.

Farms is not that good on Paper as on Vanilla, but what about performance. Performance is actually good, and most likely the most stable core you could choose, if you don't want to jump into a deephole of cores and start learning about each difference between them *(and eventually understand, that everyone just forks Paper)*, there nothing actually I could tell about performance, because I don't have a lot of experience in synthetic tests, however, you still can google it out.

I would recommend [`Paper`]() for big servers, that are not related to Vanilla Multiplayer, since it's ruins pretty big crunch of farms or redstone contraptions, however it doesn't mean, that it can't be fixed, you can still change and tweak paper's config to make it work again, but might require some time.
